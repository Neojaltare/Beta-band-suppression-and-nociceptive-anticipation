# README

This repository contains code from an ongoing project investigating the suppression of beta-band oscillations and corticomuscular coherence during the anticipation of a nociceptive stimulus.

Specifically, the project examines:
- Suppression of beta-band activity in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (EEG)
- Ipsilateral muscular activity in the forearm (EMG)
- Changes in corticomuscular coherence during stimulus anticipation

## Notes
- This is an ongoing project. The code may be updated or revised over time.
- The scripts are tailored to the structure of our data and may not work directly with other datasets without modification.

The code uses a range of Python packages, including:
- `MNE` – for EEG preprocessing and analysis
- `SciPy` – for scientific computing
- `Statsmodels` – for statistical modeling and inference
- Other standard libraries as needed
